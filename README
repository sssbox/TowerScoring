python manage.py runserver_plus <your ip>:8000


Getting some stuff to work:
log into http://<your ip>:8000/admin/
click 'Users'

Add user "scorer1" (with a short password) click "Save and continue editing"
Make that user "Staff status" and "save"
# If you want you can repeat three more times for extra scorers


Add user "timer" (with a good password) click "Save and continue editing"
Make user "Staff status" AND add them to the group "Timers" before saving


Click on "home" in the nav bar to get back to the original logged in page.
Click on the "add" button to the right of "scoring devices"
Select a scorer and add them to a non-center tower that has not yet been assigned. (and Save) (eventually this will be controllable from the main Scorekeeper's (not scorer) control panel)

Open a different browser (Firefox vs Chrome (incognito doesn't work with django's dev server for some reason)) and go to http://<your ip>:8000/
Log in as 'timer'

Use your phone on your wifi to go to http://<your ip>:8000/ and log in as a scorer.

From the original superuser account go to http://<your ip>:8000/ and you should see a pretty awesome scorekeeper display.
